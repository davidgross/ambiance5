Ambiance5 Theme I Hacked togeather. 

DISCLAIMER: This .deb file installs a heavily modified ambiance theme with pieces from Ambiance-MATE and 02-Crunchy-orange themes by: www.ravefinity.blogspot.com and http://www.noobslab.com/2013/04/ambiance-crunchy-themes-for-ubuntu.html respectively; I have hacked bits of both themes together to make it work together, I make no guarantee that it will(or wont) work on any system. Or on anything other than Debian Jessie with MATE.
